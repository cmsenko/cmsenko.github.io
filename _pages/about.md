Hey! Thanks for stopping in. I'm an aspiring linguist currently applying to PhD programs in the U.S., U.K., and Canada.

I'm broadly interested in the relationship between language change and identity. My research utilizes sociophonetic and computational methods to analyze specific linguistic variables, which can point us to the conditioning, driving factors, and progress of both large- and small-scale systematic changes. With further study, I aim to fold metalinguistic commentary and stereotype information into this work as new ways to uncover the cognitive, social, and linguistic mechanisms driving such changes.

I graduated from Northwestern University in 2022 with a B.S./M.A. in Linguistics, where I studied with [Annette D'Onofrio](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/akd2621/) and [Rob Voigt](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/robvoigt/). During this time, I explored sociolinguistic topics through two main projects. In the first, Rob and I researched gendered reference on Twitter using computational methods. In the second, Annette and I traced processes of sociolinguistic differentiation in productions of and discourse surrounding the CHICAGO vowel.

Feel free to reach out should you have any questions, and especially if you don't -- I love to chat.
